Run and Hide solves the problem of colonists getting themselves killed by fleeing into unsafe places (i.e. away from the colony, into corners, etc.) by allowing the player to place a marker which designates a spot that the colonist can run to for safety. Colonists will flee to the nearest pre-placed bunker spot whenever they run into danger.
	
Compatible with every mod and can be installed on existing saves.
